# Object_Detection-
step1: open this zipfile and follow the below instructions(this project is build in vs code generating virtual envirment)
step2: install necessary libraries (pip install ultralytics opencv-python matplotlib)
step3: open the file for webcam_live deduction(cam.py)
step4: open the file for image deduction(image.py)
step5: open the file for recorded video deduction(video.py)
step6: for run this code you can use the command (python cam.py/image.py/video.py) or use the run button of vs code as well.
step7: stop running output press 'q' word from keyboard 


important Note: (we can use custom trained model (Best.pt) or pretrained model as well (yolov8n.pt, yolov8s.pt, yolov8m.pt, yolov8l.pt, yolov8x.pt) change in code accordingly.
